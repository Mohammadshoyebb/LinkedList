/**
 * Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Accuracy: 45.95%
 * Submissions: 229K+
 * Points: 2
 * 
 * Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all others duplicates are to be removed.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input:
 * N = 4
 * value[] = {5, 2, 2, 4}
 * Output: 5 2 4
 * Explanation: Given linked list elements are
 * 5->2->2->4, in which 2 is repeated only.
 * So, we will delete the extra repeated
 * elements 2 from the linked list and the
 * resultant linked list will contain 5->2->4.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input:
 * N = 5
 * value[] = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Given linked list elements are
 * 2->2->2->2->2, in which 2 is repeated. So,
 * we will delete the extra repeated elements
 * 2 from the linked list and the resultant
 * linked list will contain only 2.
 * 
 * Your Task:
 * You have to complete the method removeDuplicates() which takes 1 argument: the head of the linked list. Your function should return a pointer to a linked list with no duplicate element.
 * 
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= size of linked lists <= 106
 * 0 <= numbers in list <= 104
